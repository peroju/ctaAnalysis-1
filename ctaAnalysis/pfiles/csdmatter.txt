Computes UL on annihilation cross-section


Synopsis
--------

This script computes the upper-limits (for a given confidence level)
on annihilation cross-section or decay lifetime of dark matter particles.
Given an observation, a DM model is fitted, then the TS is computed using
ctlike. If TS is less than some value, the script computes the differential
flux at some reference energy.

By the moment, csdmatter only computes for the case of annihilation of DM :)

General parameters
------------------

inobs [file]
    Input event list, counts cube or observation definition XML file.

inmodel [file]
    Input model XML file.

srcname [string]
    Name of the source in the source model XML file which should be used
    for spectrum generation.

expcube [file]
    Input exposure cube file.

psfcube [file]
    Input PSF cube file.

edispcube [file]
    Input energy dispersion cube file.

bkgcube [file]
    Input background cube file.

caldb [string]
    Calibration database.

irf [string]
    Instrumental response function.

(edisp = no) [boolean]
    Apply energy dispersion to response computation?

dmass [real]
    Mass of DM particle (in TeV)

sigmav [real]
    Annihilation cross-section of DM (in cm**3/s)

outfile [file]
    Output spectrum FITS file.

ebinalg <FILE|LIN|LOG|POW> [string]
    Algorithm for defining energy bins. For FILE, the energy bins are defined
    in a FITS file that is specified by the ebinfile parameter, for LIN
    LOG and POW there will be enumbins energy bins spaced linearly,
    logarithmically, or following a power law between emin and emax,
    respectively. For POW, the parameter ebingamma specifies the slope
    of the power law.

emin [real]
    Lower energy value for first energy bin (in TeV) if LIN or LOG
    energy binning algorithms are used.

emax [real]
    Upper energy value for last energy bin (in TeV) if LIN or LOG
    energy binning algorithms are used.

enumbins [integer]
    Number of energy bins if LIN or LOG energy binning algorithms are
    used.

ebinfile [file]
    Name of the file containing the energy binning definition if ebinalg=FILE.
    You may use csebins to generate a file with appropriate energy binning.

ebingamma [real]
    Exponent of the power law for POW energy binning. An exponent of 1.0
    corresponds to a logarithmic energy binning.

(statistic = DEFAULT) <DEFAULT|CSTAT|WSTAT|CHI2> [string]
    Optimization statistic. DEFAULT uses the default statistic for all
    observations, which is CSTAT or the statistic specified in the
    observation definition XML file. CSTAT uses the C statistic for
    all observations, WSTAT uses the W statistic for all On/Off
    observations, and CHI2 uses the Chi squared statistic for all
    binned or stacked observations.

(calc_ts = yes) [boolean]
    Compute TS for each spectral point?

(calc_ulim = yes) [boolean]
    Compute upper limit for each spectral point?

(fix_srcs = yes) [boolean]
    Fix other sky model parameters?

(fix_bkg = no) [boolean]
    Fix background model parameters?


Standard parameters
-------------------

(nthreads = 0) [integer]
    Number of parallel processes (0=use all available CPUs).

(publish = no) [boolean]
    Specifies whether the spectrum should be published on VO Hub.

(chatter = 2) [integer]
    Verbosity of the executable:
     chatter = 0: no information will be logged

     chatter = 1: only errors will be logged

     chatter = 2: errors and actions will be logged

     chatter = 3: report about the task execution

     chatter = 4: detailed report about the task execution

(clobber = yes) [boolean]
    Specifies whether an existing source spectrum output file should be
    overwritten.

(debug = no) [boolean]
    Enables debug mode. In debug mode the executable will dump any log file
    output to the console.

(mode = ql) [string]
    Mode of automatic parameters (default is ql, i.e. "query and learn").

(logfile = csdmatter.log) [filename]
    Log filename.
